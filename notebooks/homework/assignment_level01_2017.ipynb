    "Consider a long line of 200 people who have qued to make a withdrawal of their savings from an ATM of some arbitrary bank. Each person in the line is between the ages of 15 and 90 years old. No person in this line shares the same age; that is they are all unique and we consider fractional years (e.g. 40.13 years old). Additionally, a person's age has no relation to their position in the line; it is completely random. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The bank finds out one of these customers is about to hack the ATM and steal the savings for all remaining customers standing behind them, as they attempt to make a withdrawal. The bank can prevent the hack by shutting down their system at any time, but thereafter the ATM will be inaccessible for the remainder of the day. However, the bank has received a tip-off that this person is approximately between 40 to 45 years of age. Let's also assume the bank nefariously has GPS tracking on all of its customers, and has therefore created a small database describing the initials, age, gender and current savings ($) of each of these 200 customers, as they have appeared in the line. Because it's only an <i>approximate</i> age (or range), there could be more than one possible suspect, so the bank needs to decide on when to close their system before the attack happens.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Your task below is to therefore use Python to find the position(s) of the person(s) that fall within the <b>40-45</b> age range. You must then determine, which of these suspects the bank needs to close its systems on in order to prevent the <i>least amount of financial damage</i> and calculate the overall potential damage that has been avoided by doing so.\n",
